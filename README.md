## OBJECTIVE: 
**CREATING A CODE EDITOR LIKE CODEPEN/CODESANDBOX/... FOR MYSELF(https://github.com/abhishekchaturvedi-07), TO FEEL GOOD TO WORK ON MY OWN CODE EDITOR, WHERE I CAN CREATE SOME DOCUMENT OR CHEATSHEET AFTER MY TRIAL WORK AND THEN CAN DIRECTLY APPLY THE CODE IN MY PRODUCTION LEVEL CODE TO OPTIMIZE IT IN A BETTER WAY. THIS WILL WORK SAME AS SOME ONLINE EDITOR TOOLS,I WAS ALWAYS WONDERED HOW THEY WORK, NOW I UNDERSTAND THE MEHANSM BEHIND THE SCENE AND STARTING TO IMPLEMENT IT FOR MY OWN. BEFORE WORKING ON THIS I ALREADY WORKED ON THE BASICS OF THE ONLINE TRANSPILER AND DYANAMIC UPDATION OF DEPENDENCIES FROM NPM, SO WILL HELP ME CREATING THIS AWESOME APPLICATION**
